Course Project
========================================

This repo contains FreshRamen's project for the course *Getting and Cleaning Data* in the Coursera Data Science track. 

It contains the following files: 
* This readme file (`README.md`)
* An annotated R-script, `run_analysis.R`, which creates the two datasets. 
* `cookbook.md`, a markdown file detailing the tidy data file

The script requires the package `data.table` to be installed. 

For detailed instructions, please read the comments in the script itself. All the steps performed are explained within the script.
