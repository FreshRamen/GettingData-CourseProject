Cookbook for tidy dataset
=========================

The dataset represents a tidy version of the *Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset V1*, available via [cloudfront]. Additional details regarding the dataset are provided by [UCL Irvine]. 

30 subjects participated in the experiment (identified by variable **Subject**). 30% of whome were sorted into a *test* sample and 70% into a *training* sample, which is captured by the variable **Dataset**. Each subject performed an activity while wearing the smartphone devide, which is identified by the variable **Activity**.
